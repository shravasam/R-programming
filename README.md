R-Data types
  when programming in R.you must remember below data types which helps to analysis statistical data specially.
  
  Vectors:When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use c() function. which means to combine the elements into a vector.
  
  Lists: A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors,functions and even another list inside it.
  
  Matrices:A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.
  
  Arrays:While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions.The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the                            required number of dimension.
  
  Factors:Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.                 Factors are created using the factor() function.The nlevels functions gives the count of levels.
  
  Data Frames:Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list of vectors of equal length. Data Frames are created using the                    data.frame() function.
